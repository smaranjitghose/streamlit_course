# Module 4: Input & Interaction with Widgets

### Topic 4.1: Buttons


<br>

#### **Introduction**

Ever used a website where you could filter data, type something into a search bar, or click a button to see a result? Those little interactive components are called **widgets.** They're the magic that turns a static page into a dynamic application that responds to what you do. In Streamlit, widgets like buttons, sliders, text inputs, and checkboxes are your secret to building powerful, user-friendly tools. The moment a user interacts with a widget‚Äîsay, by moving a slider or clicking a button‚ÄîStreamlit automatically reruns your entire script from top to bottom. It's a bit like pressing a refresh button that knows what to keep and what to change.

Let's start with the simplest and most powerful widget: the button (`st.button`). Just like a "Submit" or "Buy Now" button you click every day, a Streamlit button allows your users to trigger an action with a single click. When a user clicks a button, it briefly returns a `True` value. This triggers Streamlit's rerun, and your script can then check for that `True` value to execute a specific action. This straightforward, declarative approach is what makes building interactive apps in Streamlit so fast and intuitive.

#### **Mini Project**

You‚Äôre at a lively party. In the corner stands a playful robot entertainer. Guests can walk up and press one of two big glowing buttons:
- Hit the **Balloon Button**, and the robot gleefully releases colorful balloons that float around, filling the room with a festive vibe.
- Press the **Snowflake Button**, and suddenly the space transforms into a magical winter scene, with snowflakes gently falling around you.

That‚Äôs exactly what MoodSwitch does in app form. With just one click, you can flip the entire mood ‚Äî from festive fun to magical calm ‚Äî showing how interactive buttons can instantly transform the experience.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st

# App title
st.title("üåÄ MoodSwitch")

st.write("Flip the vibe instantly ‚Äî will it be balloons or snow?")

# Party Mode button
if st.button("üéà Party Mode"):
    st.balloons()
    st.write("The mood is set: üéâ It's party time with balloons!")

# Snow Mode button
if st.button("‚ùÑÔ∏è Snow Mode"):
    st.snow()
    st.write("The mood is set: ‚ùÑÔ∏è A magical winter wonderland begins!")
```

**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

-   The `st.button()` function creates a clickable button with the text you provide as the label. When clicked, the button returns `True` for exactly one script run, and then immediately goes back to returning `False`. This makes buttons perfect for triggering quick, one-time actions or events.
    
-   In our **MoodSwitch** app, we have two separate `if` statements, each tied to a different button. When the **"üéà Party Mode"** button is clicked, `st.button("üéà Party Mode")` evaluates to `True`, and the code inside that block executes, calling `st.balloons()` to release a fun balloon animation across the screen.
    
-   Similarly, when the **"‚ùÑÔ∏è Snow Mode"** button is clicked, `st.snow()` is triggered, which creates a snowfall animation effect. These built-in Streamlit effects are designed to add delightful, interactive touches to your apps with just a single line of code.

----

#### **Key Learning Points**

- **User experience design:** Buttons should signal clear intent ‚Äî use descriptive labels or emojis to make their purpose instantly obvious.

- **Grouping actions:** When multiple buttons exist, arrange them logically (e.g., side by side or under related sections) to reduce user confusion.

- **Feedback matters:** Pair buttons with visible outcomes (animations, status messages, or results) so users know their click was successful.

- **Scalability tip:** For many related actions, consider menus or radio buttons instead of crowding the interface with too many buttons.
----

#### **Conclusion**

Buttons are the foundation of interactivity in Streamlit. They turn a static app into a dynamic experience that responds to a user's direct input. With just a few lines of Python, you can give users the power to control your application, making your data-driven projects feel responsive and alive.

### Topic 4.2: Basic Input Widgets


<br>

#### **Introduction**

Think of Streamlit apps as conversations between the user and your code. The moment someone types their name into a box or slides a number up and down, your app listens and reacts instantly. Widgets like `st.text_input()` and `st.number_input()` make it effortless for users to provide information, while Streamlit automatically turns that input into variables your Python code can use right away.

The magic is in how seamless it feels: no ‚ÄúSubmit‚Äù buttons, no complex event handling ‚Äî just type, click, or adjust, and watch the results change in real time. This declarative, reactive model transforms static scripts into interactive tools that feel alive and responsive.

#### **Mini Project**

Dinner‚Äôs done, the check is on the table, and now comes the moment of truth: the tip. Instead of fumbling with mental math, you pull up **TipMate**.

-   Enter your **name**, so the app can personalize the calculation.
    
-   Choose your **tip percentage**, whether it‚Äôs a quick 10% or a generous 25%.
    
-   The app instantly shows the **tip amount** and the **final bill total**, making the process smooth and stress-free.
    

That‚Äôs exactly what **TipMate** does ‚Äî a simple, interactive app that turns the end-of-dinner math into a one-click experience, showing how input widgets can power real-time calculations.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st

# App Title
st.title("üí∏ TipMate")

st.write("No more mental math ‚Äî calculate your tip in seconds!")

# Static bill amount
bill_amount = 1000.0  # fixed bill amount (‚Çπ)

# User inputs
name = st.text_input("üë§ Enter Your Name")
tip_percent = st.number_input("üíØ Enter Tip Percentage (%)", min_value=0.0, max_value=100.0, step=1.0)

# Calculations
tip_amount = (bill_amount * tip_percent) / 100
final_bill = bill_amount + tip_amount

# Bill Summary section
st.subheader("üìä Bill Summary")
st.metric(label="üíµ Bill Amount", value=f"‚Çπ{bill_amount:.2f}")
st.metric(label="üí∞ Tip Amount", value=f"‚Çπ{tip_amount:.2f}")
st.metric(label="üßæ Final Bill (with Tip)", value=f"‚Çπ{final_bill:.2f}")

if name and tip_percent > 0:
    st.write(f"Thanks, {name}! Your tip is ‚Çπ{tip_amount:.2f}, making the total ‚Çπ{final_bill:.2f}.")

```

**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py

```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

-   The `st.text_input()` function creates an input field where users can type text. In this app, it‚Äôs used to capture the diner‚Äôs **name**. If the field is empty, it returns an empty string; once the user types something, the value updates instantly.
    
-   The `st.number_input()` function creates an input field that accepts numeric values. It takes several important parameters:
    
    -   `label` is what users see above the input field
        
    -   `min_value` sets the lowest acceptable number
        
    -   `max_value` sets the highest
        
    -   `step` determines how much the value changes when users click the up/down arrows.  
        In this app, it‚Äôs used to enter the **tip percentage**.
- When users type in these input fields or use the arrow buttons, Streamlit immediately captures the new values and stores them in the variables (`bill_amount` and `tip_percent`).

#### **Conclusion**

By combining a variety of input widgets like `st.text_input()` and `st.number_input()`, you can build a rich, two-way conversation with your users. These widgets are the fundamental building blocks of responsive apps, turning static data into interactive experiences that are both useful and easy to navigate.

### Topic 4.3: Selection Elements


<br>

#### **Introduction**

Selection elements are like the conversation buttons between your app and its users ‚Äî every menu click, slider slide, or toggle flip instantly tells your app what the user wants, and the app springs into action without missing a beat.
Each type of selection element has its perfect use: 
- `st.radio()` is ideal when a user must pick exactly one option

- `st.selectbox()` keeps things tidy by hiding multiple choices in a dropdown 

- `st.slider()` lets users slide along a numeric range for fine-grained input

- `st.checkbox()` offers a simple yes/no toggle.

#### **Mini Project**

You‚Äôre at a bustling coffee shop, and the barista hands you a tablet to place your order. You pick your favorite coffee type, choose the perfect size, slide to adjust the sweetness, and tap your favorite toppings. With each choice, the order updates instantly, giving you a fully customized drink exactly the way you like it.
This project demonstrates how selection widgets ‚Äî from dropdowns to sliders to checkboxes ‚Äî can work together to create a seamless, interactive experience that feels as natural as ordering in real life.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("‚òï Coffee Order App")

# Coffee selection widgets
coffee_type = st.radio(
    "Choose your coffee type:",
    ["Espresso", "Latte", "Cappuccino"]
)

coffee_size = st.selectbox(
    "Select coffee size:",
    ["Small", "Medium", "Large"]
)

sugar = st.slider(
    "Sugar level (teaspoons):",
    min_value=0, max_value=5, step=1
)

whipped_cream = st.checkbox("Add whipped cream topping")

# Display order summary
st.subheader("üìù Your Coffee Order:")
order_summary = f"- {coffee_size} {coffee_type}\n- Sugar: {sugar} tsp"

if whipped_cream:
    order_summary += "\n- With whipped cream üç¶"
else:
    order_summary += "\n- No whipped cream"

st.write(order_summary)

```

**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py

```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

-   **`st.radio()`** function creates a set of radio buttons where users can select **exactly one option** from a provided list. It takes at least two parameters:
    
    -   `label`: The text displayed above the buttons.
        
    -   `options` (list): The set of choices users can pick from.  
        
-   **`st.selectbox()`** function creates a **dropdown menu**, which saves vertical space while offering multiple choices. Like `st.radio()`, it takes:
    
    -   `label`: The text shown above the dropdown.
        
    -   `options` (list): The set of values to choose from. 
        
-   **`st.slider()`** provides an intuitive way to select numeric values within a range. Users can drag the slider handle or click to jump to a specific value. Parameters include:
    
    -   `label`: Text shown above the slider.
        
    -   `min_value` / `max_value`: Define the numeric range.
        
    -   `step`: The increment for each move. 
        
-   **`st.checkbox()`** returns `True` when checked and `False` when unchecked, making it ideal for optional add-ons like whipped cream. It takes:
    
    -   `label`: Text displayed next to the checkbox.

### Topic 4.4: Advanced Selection


<br>

#### **Introduction**

Think of `st.multiselect()` as a customizable buffet ‚Äî users can pile their plate with as many options as they like. Instead of picking just one, they select multiple items from a dropdown with checkboxes, and your app immediately knows every choice.

Next, `st.pills()` acts like a set of colorful buttons, letting users switch between categories or views effortlessly ‚Äî almost like flipping through tabs on a menu, instantly highlighting their current selection.

Finally, `st.feedback()` gives users a simple, intuitive way to express opinions, rate choices, or leave quick comments, turning passive selections into active, personalized input.

Together, these advanced selection widgets create rich, interactive experiences where user preferences, choices, and feedback are captured in real time, making applications feel responsive, intuitive, and highly engaging.

#### **Mini Project**

You‚Äôre building a movie night planner that turns indecision into excitement. Users can pick all their favorite genres, choose the streaming platform they prefer, and get tailored film recommendations for the perfect night in. After watching, they can share feedback on the recommended movie.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:


```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("üé• Movie Night Planner")

# Select multiple movie genres
genres = st.multiselect(
    "Select your favorite movie genres:",
    ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror", "Sci-Fi", "Romance"]
)

# Select streaming service using pills
service = st.pills(
    "Choose your preferred streaming service:",
    ["Netflix", "Hulu", "Disney+", "Amazon Prime"]
)

# Movie recommendations based on genre
recommendations = {
    "Action": "Extraction",
    "Comedy": "The Mask", 
    "Drama": "The Godfather",
    "Horror": "A Quiet Place",
    "Sci-Fi": "Interstellar",
    "Romance": "La La Land"
}

# Show recommendation if genres selected
if genres and service:
    recommended_movie = recommendations.get(genres[0], "Movie Not Found")
    st.subheader(f"üé¨ Recommended: {recommended_movie}")
    st.write(f"Available on {service}")
    
    # Collect feedback using st.feedback
    st.write("Rate this recommendation:")
    feedback = st.feedback("stars")
    
    if feedback is not None:
        rating_text = ["Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent"]
        st.write(f"Thanks for rating: {rating_text[feedback]} ({feedback + 1} stars)")
else:
    if not genres:
        st.write("Select at least one genre to get started.")
    if not service:
        st.write("Choose a streaming service to see recommendations.")
```

**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

- The `st.multiselect()` function creates a dropdown that allows users to select multiple items from the provided list, returning a list of all selected options.

- The `st.pills()` function displays options as pill buttons, providing a modern, visually appealing way to select a single option. This creates a more engaging interface than traditional radio buttons.

- The `st.feedback()` function creates a star rating widget that returns an integer index (0-4) representing the selected star rating, making it perfect for collecting user feedback on recommendations.

- The conditional logic ensures recommendations appear only when both genres and streaming service are selected, creating a complete user input before showing results.

---

#### **Conclusion**

Advanced selection widgets like `st.multiselect()`, `st.pills()`, and `st.feedback()` enable sophisticated user interfaces that feel modern and engaging. The movie night planner demonstrates how these widgets work together to create personalized experiences with multiple input types and user feedback collection.
