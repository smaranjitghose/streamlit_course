# Module 4: Input & Interaction with Widgets

## Topic 4.1: Widgets

### What are Widgets?

Widgets are  **interactive components**  in Streamlit apps that allow users to input data or make selections. Examples include buttons, checkboxes, sliders, text inputs, dropdowns, and more.

### Widget Basics & Streamlit‚Äôs Rerun Model

-   Every time a user interacts with a widget,  **Streamlit reruns your entire script from top to bottom**, preserving widget states automatically.
    
-   Each widget returns its  **current value**  as a Python variable, which you can use to update the app.
    
-   This rerun model means you write simple, declarative Python code. When a widget changes, the entire app uses the new input to execute fresh and update the UI instantly.
    
-   Widgets have parameters like  `label`,  `default value`, and optional  `key`  (to uniquely identify and persist state).
    

This  **simplicity allows you to build complex, dynamic interfaces without callbacks or frontend code**.


### Tips on Widgets

-   Use  `st.text_input()`,  `st.slider()`,  `st.checkbox()`,  `st.selectbox()`, etc. to gather different types of user input.
    
-   Use  `st.sidebar.*`  variants to neatly organize input widgets in a sidebar panel.
    
-   Widgets can be controlled and accessed programmatically via  `st.session_state`  for advanced scenarios.
----------


### **Mini Project: Add a Button**

Streamlit makes it easy to add **interactive widgets** that respond to user actions. The simplest one is a **button**, which runs code when clicked.

- Create a fie `app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Widget Demo: Button")

if st.button("Say Hello"):
    st.write("Hello!")
else:
    st.write("Click the button to greet.")

``` 
----

**Run the app**
- `streamlit run app.py`
----------

### **Expected Output**

-   A **title**: ‚ÄúWidget Demo: Button‚Äù.
    
-   A **button** labeled _‚ÄúSay Hello‚Äù_.
    
-   Before clicking ‚Üí text shows _‚ÄúClick the button to greet.‚Äù_
    
-   After clicking ‚Üí text changes to _‚ÄúHello!‚Äù_
    

----------

### **Explanation**

-   **`st.button("Say Hello")`** ‚Üí creates a clickable button.
    
-   The button **returns `True` only when clicked**, which triggers the first branch of the `if`.
    
-   On click ‚Üí the app reruns and displays _Hello!_.
    
-   Otherwise ‚Üí it prompts the user to click.
    
This demo helps learners see **Streamlit‚Äôs rerun behavior** in real-time: each interaction triggers a re-execution of the script.

## Topic 4.2: Button 


### Introduction

Buttons are fundamental interactive elements in almost every web or mobile app. They act as the  **main triggers**  for events‚Äîfrom submitting a form, starting a calculation, to triggering animations or fun visual effects.

In Streamlit, buttons are incredibly straightforward to use yet powerful. Each button creates a clickable widget that  **returns  `True`  only on the instant it is clicked**, causing Streamlit to rerun the script and update the app. This rerun model means that button clicks act as  **events**  that your app can respond to gracefully with simple, linear Python code ‚Äî no complex frontend or callback management required.

Using buttons, you can build highly interactive and engaging apps with  **event-driven reactions**  like showing celebratory balloons, snow effects, or switching app modes. This immediate visual feedback creates a delightful user experience and solidifies the concept of interactivity for learners.

----------

### Mini Project : Celebration App with Buttons

This mini project demonstrates how to use Streamlit buttons to trigger  **fun, event-based effects**  that respond instantly to user input.

The app will have:

-   A  **‚Äúüéâ Party Mode‚Äù button**  that, when clicked, displays a balloon animation using  `st.balloons()`.
    
-   A  **‚Äú‚ùÑÔ∏è Snow Mode‚Äù button**  that triggers a snow animation using  `st.snow()`.
    
-----
- Create a file `app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("üéä Celebration App")

if st.button("üéâ Party Mode"):
    st.balloons()

if st.button("‚ùÑÔ∏è Snow Mode"):
    st.snow()
```
----
**Run the app**
- `streamlit run app.py`

----

### Expected Output

-----

### Explanation
-   **`st.button()`** ‚Üí creates interactive buttons. Each click reruns the app and evaluates the condition.
    
-   **`st.balloons()`** ‚Üí launches a **balloon animation** for a celebration effect.
    
-   **`st.snow()`** ‚Üí launches a **snow animation**, adding a cool visual effect.
    
-   By combining these with buttons, we make the app **event-driven** ‚Äî animations trigger instantly when users interact.
    
This project shows how Streamlit can go beyond data apps and be used for **playful, interactive experiences**.

## Topic 4.3: Basic Input Widgets 


### Introduction

User inputs are the heart of interactivity in Streamlit apps. Widgets like  `st.number_input`,  `st.text_input`, and  `st.slider`  let users feed  **numeric or text data**  into your app effortlessly. Streamlit then  **reruns the script automatically**  and uses the new input values to update outputs instantly ‚Äî no complex callback code needed.

This declarative, real-time reaction model makes it easy to build apps where user input controls live computations and visualizations.

One practical and relatable example is a  **Restaurant Tip Calculator**  ‚Äî where the bill amount and tip percent are inputs, and the app dynamically calculates the final amount to pay. This helps learners:

-   Understand how to collect numeric inputs with  `st.number_input`.
    
-   Perform live calculations based on input values.
    
-   Display updated results dynamically as users change inputs.
    

This project connects basic input widgets with real-world usefulness, reinforcing the power of interactive apps.

----------


### Mini  Tip Calculator

You often dine out and want a quick way to calculate the **total bill including tip**. This app helps you do just that in seconds.

- Create a file `app.py`

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("üí∏ Tip Calculator")

# Input fields
bill_amount = st.number_input("Enter Bill Amount (‚Çπ)", min_value=0.0, step=50.0)
tip_percent = st.number_input("Enter Tip Percentage (%)", min_value=0.0, max_value=100.0, step=1.0)

# Calculations
tip_amount = (bill_amount * tip_percent) / 100
final_bill = bill_amount + tip_amount

# Results
st.subheader("üìä Bill Summary")
st.metric(label="Tip Amount", value=f"‚Çπ{tip_amount:.2f}")
st.metric(label="Final Bill (with Tip)", value=f"‚Çπ{final_bill:.2f}")
```
---

**Run the app**
- `streamlit run app.py`
----------

### Expected Output

        

----------

### Explanation

-   **`st.number_input()`** ‚Üí lets the user input numeric values (bill and tip percentage).
    
-   **Live computation** ‚Üí as inputs change, the script recalculates tip and final bill instantly.
    
-   **`st.metric()`** ‚Üí displays key results in **highlighted cards** for easy visibility.
    

Learners practice numeric input handling and connect it to **real-time calculations**, making a **practical utility app** that gives immediate visual feedback.

## Topic 4.4: Selection Elements

### **Introduction**

You walk into your favorite caf√©. The barista smiles and asks, ‚ÄúWhat would you like today?‚Äù Your choices matter: type of coffee, size, sweetness, maybe some whipped cream on top... It‚Äôs a small but exciting decision-making moment that shapes your perfect cup.

Just like ordering coffee,  **apps often need users to select options**‚Äîand Streamlit makes building that selection experience a breeze.

----------

#### **Why Selection Widgets Matter**

Selection widgets are the  **interactive menus, sliders, and toggles**  of your app world. They let users  **express their preferences clearly and quickly**‚Äîand your app instantly reacts with what they choose.

Here‚Äôs the secret sauce:

-   **`st.radio()`**  is like a set of sturdy buttons lined up. It works great when users must pick  **exactly one**  option from a handful. Like choosing your favorite brew.
    
-   **`st.selectbox()`**  hides all choices neatly in a dropdown‚Äîperfect for longer lists where space matters, think of picking your coffee size: Small, Medium, or Large.
    
-   **`st.slider()`**  invites users to slide a knob along a range, just like adding sugar or strength level. It‚Äôs tactile, intuitive, and fun to use.
    
-   **`st.checkbox()`**  is a simple yes/no toggle‚Äîdo you want whipped cream? Check it or leave it unchecked. Easy!
    

----------

#### **How Does It Work?**

Each widget waits patiently for your input. When you make a choice, Streamlit reruns the script with your new preferences baked in. Widgets return these choices as Python variables you can use right away to update your app‚Äôs display.

No confusing callbacks, no boilerplate code‚Äîjust  _declarative_  and  _immediate_  interaction.
