# Module 9: Managing State & Performance

### Topic 9.1: Session State (single page)

----

#### **Introduction**

Web applications face a fundamental challenge with user data persistence‚Äîevery interaction triggers a complete refresh that wipes out previously entered information, forcing users to repeatedly input the same data or lose their progress entirely. This stateless behavior, while simple to implement, creates frustrating experiences where accumulated work disappears with a single misclick, breaking user workflows and making complex interactions nearly impossible to manage effectively.

Streamlit's `st.session_state` solves this memory problem by providing persistent storage that survives script reruns, enabling applications to remember and maintain data across multiple user interactions. Session state functions as a dictionary-like object where you can store any Python data type and access it throughout your application, creating sophisticated user experiences that handle complex workflows while preserving user progress and maintaining data consistency across all interactions.

#### **Mini Project**

Deepak is shopping online for his home office setup, carefully selecting a desk, chair, and accessories across multiple product pages, but every time he navigates back to browse more items, his cart empties and he has to start over. He's frustrated by losing his selections and having to remember what he already picked. An online store with persistent cart functionality would let Deepak build up his order gradually, make changes as he shops, and maintain his selections throughout his entire browsing session without losing progress.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("üõçÔ∏è Online Store")

# Initialize session state for cart
if 'cart' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.cart = []

# Available products
products = {
    "Laptop": 25000,
    "Mouse": 349,
    "Keyboard": 499,
    "Monitor": 7999,
    "Headphones": 799
}

# Product selection form
with st.form("add_product_form"):
    st.subheader("Add Product to Cart")
    selected_product = st.selectbox("Choose a product:", list(products.keys()))
    quantity = st.number_input("Quantity:", min_value=1, max_value=10, value=1)
    
    if st.form_submit_button("Add to Cart"):
        item = {
            "name": selected_product,
            "price": products[selected_product],
            "quantity": quantity,
            "total": products[selected_product] * quantity
        }
        st.session_state.cart.append(item)
        st.success(f"Added {quantity}x {selected_product} to cart!")

# Display cart
st.subheader("Shopping Cart")
if st.session_state.cart:
    for i, item in enumerate(st.session_state.cart):
        col1, col2, col3, col4 = st.columns([3, 1, 1, 1])
        with col1:
            st.write(f"{item['name']}")
        with col2:
            st.write(f"‚Çπ{item['price']}")
        with col3:
            st.write(f"Qty: {item['quantity']}")
        with col4:
            if st.button("Remove", key=f"remove_{i}"):
                st.session_state.cart.pop(i)
                st.rerun()
    
    # Cart total
    total_cost = sum(item['total'] for item in st.session_state.cart)
    st.subheader(f"Total: ‚Çπ{total_cost}")
    
    # Clear cart button
    if st.button("Clear Cart"):
        st.session_state.cart = []
        st.rerun()
else:
    st.write("Your cart is empty")

```

**Run your app with:**

```
streamlit run app.py
```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**


-   **`st.session_state`:**
    
    -   A special Streamlit dictionary that **persists values across app reruns**.
        
    -   Normally, Streamlit reruns the entire script on any user interaction, which would reset normal variables.
        
    -   Using `st.session_state`, data like the shopping cart can **persist across interactions**.
        
    -   In this project, `st.session_state.cart` stores all cart items to prevent them from being lost when the app reruns.
        
-   **Initialize session state for cart:**
    
    -   Checks if `'cart'` exists in `st.session_state`.
        
    -   If not, creates an empty list: `st.session_state.cart = []`.
        
    -   Ensures the cart is ready for storing items on first load.
        
-   **App title and product list:**
    
    -   `st.title("üõçÔ∏è Online Store")` displays the title.
        
    -   Defines a dictionary `products` with available products and their prices.
        
-   **Product selection form (`st.form`):**
    
    -   Groups the product dropdown (`st.selectbox`) and quantity input (`st.number_input`).
        
    -   Prevents the app from rerunning until the user clicks **"Add to Cart"**.
        
    -   Provides smoother UX by allowing users to adjust inputs without triggering premature updates.
        
-   **Adding items to the cart:**
    
    -   When the form is submitted:
        
        -   Creates a dictionary with `name`, `price`, `quantity`, and `total`.
            
        -   Appends the dictionary to `st.session_state.cart`.
            
        -   Displays a `st.success()` message confirming the addition.
            
    -   This allows multiple items to accumulate in the cart while maintaining their details.
        
-   **Displaying the cart:**
    
    -   Iterates through `st.session_state.cart`.
        
    -   Uses `st.columns` to neatly display: product name, price, quantity, and a remove button.
        
    -   Each remove button has a unique `key` to prevent interface conflicts.
        
-   **Removing items from the cart:**
    
    -   Clicking a remove button pops the corresponding item from the cart.
        
    -   Calls `st.rerun()` to immediately refresh the display and reflect the removal.
        
-   **Calculating and displaying total cost:**
    
    -   Sums the `total` value of all items in the cart.
        
    -   Displays the result using `st.subheader()`.
        
-   **Clearing the entire cart:**
    
    -   Clicking **"Clear Cart"** empties `st.session_state.cart`.
        
    -   `st.rerun()` ensures the UI updates immediately to show an empty cart.
        
-   **Handling an empty cart:**
    
    -   If `st.session_state.cart` is empty, displays `"Your cart is empty"`.
        
    -   Keeps the interface informative when no items have been added yet.

#### **Conclusion**

State management techniques allow applications to remember user information and maintain continuity across different sessions and interactions. These patterns create seamless experiences where progress is saved, preferences are remembered, and users can pick up exactly where they left off. The ability to persist state bridges the gap between simple, one-time tools and comprehensive platforms that build lasting relationships with users through consistent, personalized experiences.

### Topic 9.2: Multi-page Session State Management

----

#### **Introduction**

Consider an e-commerce application where users browse products on one page, add items to their cart on another, and proceed to checkout on a third page. Without proper state management, users would lose their cart contents every time they navigate between pages, forcing them to repeatedly add the same items or abandon their purchase entirely. This fragmented experience breaks user expectations and creates significant barriers to completing multi-step processes. Streamlit's session state solves this cross-page persistence challenge by automatically maintaining user context across all pages in your application.

Session state in Streamlit works seamlessly across page navigation, enabling sophisticated application flows like user authentication systems, multi-step wizards, or personalized experiences where each page can access and modify shared data. This capability allows developers to build cohesive applications that feel integrated and stateful rather than disconnected collections of individual tools, creating smooth user experiences that maintain context throughout the entire application journey.

#### **Mini Project**

Ravi is using his company's project management app, but every time he clicks between the dashboard, reports, and settings pages, he gets kicked back to the login screen and has to enter his credentials again. This constant re-authentication interrupts his workflow and wastes time during busy days. A multi-page application with persistent authentication would let Ravi log in once and seamlessly navigate between all sections without losing his session, keeping his workflow smooth and uninterrupted.

##### **Project Setup**

Create the following file structure:
```
app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_Dashboard.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2_Reports.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 3_Settings.py

```

**`main.py`** (Login page):

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("Login Page")

# Initialize session state
if "logged_in" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.logged_in = False
if "username" not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.username = ""

# Show login form if not logged in
if not st.session_state.logged_in:
    username = st.text_input("Username")
    password = st.text_input("Password", type="password")

    if st.button("Login"):
        # Simple authentication rule
        if username and password == "demo":
            st.session_state.logged_in = True
            st.session_state.username = username
            st.success(f"Welcome, {username}!")
            st.switch_page("pages/1_Dashboard.py")
        else:
            st.error("Invalid credentials. Hint: password is 'demo'")

# If already logged in
else:
    st.success(f"Already logged in as: {st.session_state.username}")
    if st.button("Go to Dashboard"):
        st.switch_page("pages/1_Dashboard.py")
    if st.button("Logout"):
        st.session_state.logged_in = False
        st.session_state.username = ""
        st.rerun()

```

**`pages/1_Dashboard.py`**:

```python
import streamlit as st

st.title("üìä Dashboard")

# Authentication check
if not st.session_state.get("logged_in", False):
    st.warning("Please log in first!")
    st.switch_page("main.py")

st.success(f"Hello, {st.session_state.username}! Welcome to your dashboard.")

# Navigation
if st.button("Go to Reports"):
    st.switch_page("pages/2_Reports.py")
if st.button("Go to Settings"):
    st.switch_page("pages/3_Settings.py")

# Logout
if st.button("Logout"):
    st.session_state.logged_in = False
    st.session_state.username = ""
    st.switch_page("main.py")

```

**`pages/2_Reports.py`**

```python

import streamlit as st

st.title("üìë Reports")

# Authentication check
if not st.session_state.get("logged_in", False):
    st.warning("Please log in first!")
    st.switch_page("main.py")

st.write(f"{st.session_state.username}, here are your project reports.")

# Navigation
if st.button("Go to Dashboard"):
    st.switch_page("pages/1_Dashboard.py")
if st.button("Go to Settings"):
    st.switch_page("pages/3_Settings.py")

# Logout
if st.button("Logout"):
    st.session_state.logged_in = False
    st.session_state.username = ""
    st.switch_page("main.py")

```
**`pages/3_Settings.py`**

```python

import streamlit as st

st.title("‚öôÔ∏è Settings")

# Authentication check
if not st.session_state.get("logged_in", False):
    st.warning("Please log in first!")
    st.switch_page("main.py")

st.write(f"{st.session_state.username}, you can update your settings here.")

# Navigation
if st.button("Go to Dashboard"):
    st.switch_page("pages/1_Dashboard.py")
if st.button("Go to Reports"):
    st.switch_page("pages/2_Reports.py")

# Logout
if st.button("Logout"):
    st.session_state.logged_in = False
    st.session_state.username = ""
    st.switch_page("main.py")

```

**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

-   **Initialize session state variables**
    
    -   At the start of `main.py`, we check if keys exist in `st.session_state`.
        
    -   If not, we create them:
        
        -   `st.session_state.logged_in = False` ‚Üí tracks whether the user is logged in.
            
        -   `st.session_state.username = ""` ‚Üí stores the current username.
            
-   **During login**
    
    -   When the user submits the login form, if the password is `"demo"`, then:
        
        -   `st.session_state.logged_in` is set to `True`.
            
        -   `st.session_state.username` is set to the entered username.
            
    -   These values persist across pages.
        
-   **Access control on each page**
    
    -   Every page (Dashboard, Reports, Settings) checks `st.session_state.get("logged_in", False)`.
        
    -   If `False`, the page warns the user and redirects back to `main.py`.
        
    -   If `True`, the page displays personalized content using `st.session_state.username`.
        
-   **Navigation between pages**
    
    -   Since `st.session_state` retains values across page loads, the user doesn‚Äôt need to log in again.
        
    -   `st.switch_page("...")` just changes the view, while the login state remains intact.
        
-   **Logout**
    
    -   On pressing `Logout`, we reset:
        
        -   `st.session_state.logged_in = False`
            
        -   `st.session_state.username = ""`
            
    -   This clears the session so the user is forced to log in again.

#### **Key Learning Points**

- Session state persists automatically across all pages in multi-page Streamlit applications

- Authentication patterns use session state to maintain login status across page navigation

- `st.stop()` prevents unauthorized access to protected pages

- Different pages can access and modify the same session state variables

- Cross-page data sharing enables integrated application experiences

#### **Conclusion**

Multi-page session state management unlocks the ability to build comprehensive applications like e-commerce platforms, learning management systems, and enterprise dashboards that maintain user context across sections. This persistent state capability enables developers to create applications where user progress, preferences, and data flow seamlessly between different functional areas. Mastering cross-page state management is essential for building web applications that compete with traditional desktop software in terms of user experience and functionality.

### Topic 9.3: Widget Callbacks

---

#### **Introduction**

Data-intensive applications face a fundamental user experience challenge‚Äîevery user interaction triggers a complete application reload, creating frustrating delays between actions and responses. When users filter datasets, update charts, or modify parameters, they expect immediate feedback, not spinning loading indicators that break their analytical flow. Traditional web applications force users to wait through full page refreshes for simple actions like adding items to lists or adjusting sliders, creating sluggish experiences that feel disconnected from the fluid interactions users expect in modern applications.

Streamlit's widget callback system eliminates these delays by allowing specific functions to execute instantly when users interact with widgets, rather than forcing entire application reruns. This creates responsive, desktop-like experiences where button clicks, input changes, and widget interactions trigger immediate responses. Widget callbacks enable complex state management, dynamic form processing, and coordinated widget interactions, transforming sluggish web applications into fluid, real-time experiences that maintain user engagement and workflow momentum.

#### **Mini Project**

Nikhil is a project manager who currently tracks his tasks across sticky notes, email drafts, and a basic notepad app. Throughout his busy days, he constantly loses track of what he's completed, forgets to add new urgent tasks from meetings, and wastes time manually crossing out outdated items when priorities change. A dedicated task tracker would give Nikhil one central place to add new tasks, check off completed work, and remove irrelevant items, transforming his chaotic task management into a streamlined daily workflow.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:

```python

import streamlit as st

# Initialize session state for tasks
if 'tasks' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.tasks = []
if 'task_input' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.task_input = ""

# Task functions 
def add_task():
    if st.session_state.task_input.strip():
        st.session_state.tasks.append({
            'text': st.session_state.task_input,
            'done': False
        })
        st.session_state.task_input = ""

def toggle_task(index):
    st.session_state.tasks[index]['done'] = not st.session_state.tasks[index]['done']

def delete_task(index):
    st.session_state.tasks.pop(index)

st.title("‚ö° QuickTasks ‚ö°")

# Add New Task Section 
st.subheader("‚ûï Add a New Task")
st.text_input("Enter your task here:", key="task_input", on_change=add_task)

# Task List Section
st.subheader("üìã Your Tasks")
if not st.session_state.tasks:
    st.info("No tasks yet. Add one above! ‚ú®")

for i, task in enumerate(st.session_state.tasks):
    col1, col2, col3 = st.columns([3, 1, 1])
    
    with col1:
        style = "text-decoration: line-through; color: gray;" if task['done'] else ""
        st.markdown(f"<span style='{style}'>{task['text']}</span>", unsafe_allow_html=True)
    
    with col2:
        status = "‚úÖ Done" if task['done'] else "‚úîÔ∏è Mark Done"
        st.button(status, key=f"toggle_{i}", on_click=toggle_task, args=(i,))
    
    with col3:
        st.button("üóëÔ∏è Delete", key=f"delete_{i}", on_click=delete_task, args=(i,))

```
**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

<img src="https://github.com/smaranjitghose/streamlit_course/blob/master/images/Module%209/mod9-task2.png">

----

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

-   **Initialize session state**
    
    -   `st.session_state.tasks` ‚Üí stores the list of tasks (each as a dictionary with `'text'` and `'done'`).
        
    -   `st.session_state.task_input` ‚Üí stores the current input value for the new task.
        
-   **Define task functions**
    
    -   `add_task()` ‚Üí adds a new task to `tasks` if the input is not empty and clears `task_input`.
        
    -   `toggle_task(index)` ‚Üí flips the `'done'` status of the task at the given index.
        
    -   `delete_task(index)` ‚Üí removes the task at the given index.
        
            
-   **Display tasks dynamically**
    
    -   Loop over `st.session_state.tasks` using `enumerate()` to get `i` (index) and `task`.
        
    -   Use `st.columns([3,1,1])` to layout each task row:
        
        -   **Column 1:** Show task text with strikethrough if done (`task['done']`).
            
        -   **Column 2:** Button to toggle done status:
            
            -   `st.button(status, key=f"toggle_{i}", on_click=toggle_task, args=(i,))`
                
            -   `on_click` calls `toggle_task` with the task index.
                
        -   **Column 3:** Button to delete the task:
            
            -   `st.button("üóëÔ∏è Delete", key=f"delete_{i}", on_click=delete_task, args=(i,))`
                
            -   `on_click` calls `delete_task` with the task index.
                
-   **Reactive updates**
    
    -   Any modification to `st.session_state.tasks` triggers a **Streamlit rerun**, instantly updating the UI.
        
    -   The `key` parameter ensures each input and button is **uniquely tracked** across reruns.
        
-   **Empty task handling**
    
    -   If `st.session_state.tasks` is empty, `st.info("No tasks yet. Add one above! ‚ú®")` shows a friendly message.

#### **Conclusion**

This callback pattern establishes a foundation for building responsive user interfaces that can be applied across web applications, dashboards, and interactive tools. The ability to connect user actions directly to functions while maintaining clean state management becomes essential when scaling applications or integrating real-time features. Mastering this approach to event-driven programming significantly improves development efficiency and creates more intuitive user experiences in any interactive project.

### Topic 9.4: Caching

---

#### **Introduction**

Data applications often become painfully slow because they repeat the same expensive work over and over again‚Äîevery time a user clicks a button, the app might re-download the same large dataset, re-query the same database, or re-train the same machine learning model, even though nothing has actually changed. These redundant operations create unnecessary delays where users wait for computations that have already been done before. Instead of instantly showing results from previous work, applications waste time and resources by starting from scratch with every interaction.

Streamlit's caching system eliminates this waste by intelligently storing expensive operation results and reusing them when inputs remain unchanged. Through `st.cache_data` for data operations and `st.cache_resource` for global resources like database connections, caching transforms slow, repetitive applications into fast, responsive tools where previously time-consuming operations now execute instantly, enabling seamless data exploration that feels immediate and encourages user engagement.
#### **Mini Project**

Shreya is researching universities abroad and constantly switches between searching for schools in different countries. Each time she revisits a country she's already explored, she has to wait for the same slow loading times as the system fetches identical university data from scratch, making her research process frustratingly repetitive. A smart university finder would cache her previous searches, instantly showing universities from countries she's already explored while fetching fresh data for new searches, eliminating unnecessary wait times.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:

```python

import streamlit as st
import requests

@st.cache_data
def fetch_universities(country):
    """Fetch universities from API and cache results"""
    url = f"http://universities.hipolabs.com/search?country={country}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

@st.cache_resource
def get_api_base_url():
    """Cache the API base configuration"""
    return "http://universities.hipolabs.com/search"

st.title("University Finder")
st.write("Search for universities by country (results are cached for faster loading)")

# Country selection
country = st.selectbox(
    "Select a country:",
    ["United States", "Canada", "United Kingdom", "Australia", "Germany"]
)

if country:
    # Show loading message
    with st.spinner(f"Searching universities in {country}..."):
        universities = fetch_universities(country)
    
    st.subheader(f"Universities in {country}")
    st.write(f"Found {len(universities)} universities")
    
    # Display first 10 universities
    for uni in universities[:10]:
        with st.expander(uni['name']):
            st.write(f"**Website:** {uni.get('web_pages', ['N/A'])[0]}")
            st.write(f"**Domain:** {uni.get('domains', ['N/A'])[0]}")
            
    # Show caching info
    st.info("üí° Try selecting the same country again - it loads instantly from cache!")

```

**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**

-   **`requests`**: A Python library that lets you send HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) to external servers or APIs and handle responses in formats like JSON, HTML, or text.
    
-   **Fetch universities with caching**
    
    -   **`@st.cache_data`** wraps `fetch_universities(country)` ‚Üí caches function output **based on input parameters**.
        
    -   The first search triggers an API call; subsequent searches for the same country **return cached results instantly**, improving performance.
        
-   **Global resource caching**
    
    -   **`@st.cache_resource`** wraps `get_api_base_url()` ‚Üí caches resources **that do not depend on input parameters**, like global configuration, database connections, or API clients.
        
-   **Loading feedback**
    
    -   **`st.spinner()`** displays a loading message while the API request is in progress, giving users visual feedback.
        
-   **Cache behavior explanation**
    
    -   **Parameter-based invalidation**: Streamlit automatically refreshes `st.cache_data` if the input parameter (`country`) changes.
        
    -   **Transparent caching**: The same function code works without modifications; Streamlit handles storage and retrieval automatically.
        
    -   **User notice**: `st.info()` can remind users that selecting the same country again loads results instantly from cache.
        

This way, `st.cache_data` is used for **parameter-dependent outputs**, while `st.cache_resource` is for **global or reusable objects**.


#### **Conclusion**

Strategic caching implementation dramatically improves application performance across web development, data processing, and API-driven projects by eliminating redundant computations. This optimization technique becomes crucial when building scalable applications that handle external data sources, large datasets, or resource-intensive operations. Mastering efficient caching strategies reduces server load, minimizes user wait times, and enables developers to create professional-grade applications that maintain responsiveness under heavy usage.

#### **Introduction**

Imagine uploading a large dataset to your Streamlit app for processing‚Äîclicking the "Analyze" button only to be met with a completely static screen for several minutes. Users have no idea if the app is working, frozen, or broken, leading many to refresh the page or abandon the process entirely. This scenario repeats across data applications whenever users trigger long-running operations like file processing, API calls, or complex calculations. Without visual feedback, even a 30-second operation feels endless, creating anxiety and uncertainty that drives users away from otherwise functional applications.

Streamlit's progress indicators and status messaging tools solve this communication gap by keeping users informed and engaged during lengthy operations. Through `st.progress()` for visual progress bars, `st.spinner()` for animated loading indicators with custom messages, and status containers for multi-step updates, these tools transform potentially frustrating wait times into reassuring progress communication. This turns user anxiety into confidence, ensuring that long-running processes feel manageable and professional rather than broken or unresponsive.

#### **Mini Project**

Rahul is a market research analyst who dreads Monday mornings when his inbox fills with chaotic CSV files‚Äîcustomer surveys with typos, sales reports missing columns, and product data riddled with duplicates from different regional offices. He spends his entire morning manually hunting down errors and inconsistencies, never knowing if he's missed something critical. A CSV cleanup app would let Rahul upload messy files and automatically detect and fix common data problems, transforming his chaotic Monday morning routine into a quick, reliable process.

##### **Project Setup**

Create a new file `app.py`:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import time

# Cleaning function

def clean_step(data, step, progress, i, total):
    time.sleep(1)
    if step == "Remove duplicates":
        cleaned = data.drop_duplicates()
        status = f"Removed {len(data) - len(cleaned)} duplicates"
    elif step == "Handle missing":
        cleaned = data.fillna("N/A")
        status = "Filled missing values"
    elif step == "Standardize text":
        cleaned = data.copy()
        for col in cleaned.select_dtypes('object'):
            cleaned[col] = cleaned[col].astype(str).str.strip().str.title()
        status = f"Standardized text in {len(cleaned.select_dtypes('object').columns)} columns"
    else:
        cleaned = data
        status = "Step complete"
    progress.progress((i + 1)/total)
    return cleaned, status

# --- Streamlit UI ---
st.title("‚ú® Quick Data Cleaner")
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload CSV", type="csv")

if uploaded_file:
    data = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
    st.success(f"Loaded {len(data)} rows, {len(data.columns)} columns")
    st.dataframe(data.head())

    if st.button("Start Cleaning"):
        steps = ["Remove duplicates", "Handle missing", "Standardize text"]
        progress = st.progress(0)
        status_text = st.empty()
        cleaned = data.copy()

        for i, step in enumerate(steps):
            status_text.text(f"Step {i+1}/{len(steps)}: {step}...")
            cleaned, step_status = clean_step(cleaned, step, progress, i, len(steps))
            status_text.text(f"‚úÖ {step_status}")

        st.success("üéâ Cleaning complete!")
        st.subheader("Cleaned Data")
        st.dataframe(cleaned.head())

```
**Run your app with:**

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

#### **Step-by-Step Walkthrough**


-   **`clean_step(data, step, progress, i, total)`**: Performs individual cleaning operations (e.g., removing duplicates, filling missing values, standardizing text) and updates the progress bar and status message for each step.
    
    -   **`progress`**: The `st.progress` object used to visually update completion status.
        
    -   **`i` / `total`**: Current step index and total steps, used to calculate progress percentage.
        
-   **`st.progress(value=0)`**: Creates a progress bar.
    
    -   **`value`** (`int` 0‚Äì100): Initial completion percentage.
        
    -   The progress bar can be updated dynamically by calling `progress.progress(new_value)` as cleaning steps are completed.
        
-   **`st.empty()`**: Creates a placeholder container for dynamic content, here used to display real-time status messages during cleaning.
    
-   **`st.success("üéâ Cleaning complete!")`**: Shows a success message when all cleaning steps are finished, giving visual feedback to the user.
    
-   **`st.dataframe(cleaned.head())`**: Displays the first 5 rows of the cleaned DataFrame so users can immediately see the results of the cleaning operations.


#### **Conclusion**

Progress indicators and status messaging keep users informed and engaged during longer operations, preventing confusion and abandonment. These visual cues transform waiting experiences into predictable interactions where users understand what's happening and how long it might take. Clear progress communication is essential for building user trust and ensuring smooth experiences in any application that involves processing or multi-step operations.
